			/preprocessed_filter_en_merged_chs_20210915: this is the dataset to start with. They have been filtered to keep only the works in English and multi-chapter works are merged into a single entry.
			/preprocessed_filter_en_merged_chs_20210915_no_crossover: outdated.
			/preprocessed_filter_en_merged_chs_20211216_no_crossover: removed crossover fictions using the info in /data/subfandom_info and the script "remove_crossover.py". The idea is to check each item in the work's `fandoms` tag and only keep the works where all items are among the top X works in the fandom (since a fandom is often a group of related works).
		/tfidf_merged_chs_20211216_no_crossover: this is the newest results for term novelty.
		/lda_merged_chs_20211216_no_crossover: newest results for topic novelty.
